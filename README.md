This is my repository of Waste Segregation Simulation using unity.
This is an android application project with two scenes:
    1)MainMenu Scene

    2)Waste Segregation Simulation Scene

The reason for there is only very few git push because , i have worked on the project without git , later used after completion of the project and pushed into github for sharing the code repository as submission.
Sorry for having less number of git push, in a single push , i uploaded all assests of my project.
